            - chat messages.



## step - 1. Starategies

        * This step focuses on laying the groundwork for the project by:
            - defining its purpose, target audience, and goals.
            - defining compase for this project - overall direction and vision of the project!
            - finding answers for:
                a. why are we building this website?
                b. who is it for?
                c. what are we trying to accomplish? what problem are we trying to solve?
                d. how do we know if we success at meeting the requirements?
            - thoroughly researching the requirements.

# Phase - 2: System Design
**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

## step - 2 Architecture and Technology Stack

        * Front-end languages and libraries
            - HTML && CSS
            - Javascript
            - Bootstrap
        * Back-end Languages and Libraries

        * Front-end & Back-end Integration
            - API Design
        * Remote Authentication (OAuth 2.0 authentication with 42) 
            - Secure sign in and sign up
        * User Mangement
            - User Profile viewing and customization option
        * Live chat
            - Web-socket for Real-time Chat system



## step - 3. Structuring (UX) && Design (UI)

        * figuring out what pages we will have. 
        * what contents will we put in these pages
        * (as much) detailed wireframing & Prototypes for all the pages and components 
            - rough sketchs of each page to see what it would look like
        * Designing a Visually apealing & consistent UI
            - Adding Colors, Fonts, Images, Icon and other Illustrations to the wireframes!
            - Story telling, MAKE or BREAK of the project!
        * Ensuring a smooth and intuitive UX
            - login/sign up
            - user profile  
            - gameplay
            - Tournament



**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**
# Phase - 3: Implementation (Coding)
**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**
## Step - 4. Development

        * Implement the SPA!!
        * Implement proper error handling and Validation mechanism
            - for user inputs
        * Industry practices, Maintainability and scalability


## Step - 5. Security and Authentication

        * Implementing secure authentication and autherization system
        * Proper handling of sensitive user data.



**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**
# Phase - 4: Testing
**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**
## Step - 6. Testing and Feedback

        * Conduct thorough testing with different user scenarios and edge cases.
        * Consider involving potential users for:
            - feedback and,
            - usability testing during the development process.
        * Iterate and refine the application based on user feedback and identified issues.



**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**
# Phase - 5: Deployment
**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**
## Step - 7. Deployment and Hosting

        * Will do nelify!

**------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**
